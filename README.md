# Two Dimensional Binary Array Search

`python3` code that find a path from the start point to the target point of a two dimensional array like the one below, with the caveat that only right and down movements are allowed:

```python
(
  (1, 1, 0),
  (0, 1, 0),
  (0, 1, 1)
)
```


## Usage

Built to run on a linux system

- [find.py](find.py) contains the function that implements the search logic
- [test.py](test.py) contains a few tests for it
- [cli.py](cli.py) contains very basic code for running it with cli arguments
